<p>The Clinic (low-cost psychoanalytic clinic) has been making steady progress since its beginning in 1954.  It is currently under the Directorship of Dr. Carroll C. Carlson.  All of our training analysts and currently thirteen candidates are participating in the psychoanalytic treatment of a carefully screened group of thirteen cases.</p>
<p>The Training School of the Institute is now operating on a daytime schedule, with most of the seminars meeting between 8:00 A.M. and 12:00 noon on Wednesdays.  This day schedule has long been the expressed preference of both students and faculty.</p>
<p>The Extension Division of the Institute, under the direction of Dr. Norman Levy, continues to offer courses to selected groups other than psychoanalysts.</p>
<p>The Institute has established two Fellowships in child analysis and is extending its seminars in this field.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the Institute has made it necessary to change the By-laws so that the heavy work of the Institute can be carried by more members of the Institute.</p>

<p>The Committee to Study the Organization of the Institute, at the last Business Meeting of the Association, presented a plan for Institute reorganization to the membership of the Association.  The proposed setup was approved by the membership and became effective July 1.  The Institute will have an Administrative Board and an Educational Committee, the former having the responsibility for business matters and procedures, the latter the responsibility for the educational policies of the Institute.  The activities of the Institute will be divided among six divisions, as follows:  Professional School Division, Division for Child Psychoanalysis, Division for Educational Psychoanalysis, Extension School, Clinic, and Research, each of the Divisions operating under the supervision of a director.</p>
<p>Over 90 per cent of the members and students of the Philadelphia Association for Psychoanalysis are active in medical schools, hospitals, professional societies and community organizations.  Recently, the Editors of the Philadelphia <i>Bulletin</i> circulated a questionnaire to the members and students of the Association.  This questionnaire asked them to list their hospital and teaching appointments as well as their activities in scientific and community organizations.  Of the 100 members and students of the Association who received the questionnaire, 95 replied.</p>
<p>A study of these replies showed that 90 per cent of the members and students are associated with medical schools, with two members being heads of departments of psychiatry and seven members holding professorships.  Six physicians are in charge of residency training in various hospitals, while two members are lecturers at state hospitals.</p>
<p>Of those replying to the questionnaire, 93 per cent hold one or more</p>

<p>The American Psychoanalytic Association at its annual meeting at Chicago, on May 12, 1957, conferred the first Charles Frederick Menninger Award on Dr. Charles Fisher.  Dr. Fisher is on the staff of the Mount Sinai Hospital of New York and is a training analyst of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.</p>
<p>The Award was established a year ago by Dr. Karl A. Menninger and Dr. William C. Menninger of the Menninger Foundation as a memorial to their</p>
<pb><n nextpgnum="P0739" prefixused="">738</n></pb>
<p2>father, who was the founder of the original Menninger Sanitarium at Topeka, Kansas.</p2><p>The Award is to be given annually for original research in psychoanalysis.  The members of the Award Committee are five former presidents of the Association:  Dr. Leo H. Bartemeier of Baltimore, Maryland; Dr. Maxwell Gitelson of Chicago, Illinois; Dr. M. Ralph Kaufman of New York City; Dr. Robert P. Knight of Stockbridge, Massachusetts; and Dr. Karl A. Menninger of Topeka, Kansas.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher received the award in recognition of experimental work on the role of primary modes of perception in dream formation.<ftnx r="F001" type="PG">1</ftnx>  In a series of carefully controlled experiments he was able to verify some of the basic theoretical principles originally postulated by Freud in his work on dreams.  The work was carried on in the Department of Psychiatry of the Mount Sinai Hospital and was made possible through the assistance of the Foundations' Fund for Research in Psychiatry.</p>
<h2 c="t">Sacha Nacht Prize</h2>
<p>A prize of 300, 000 francs has just been established to be granted every alternate year by Dr. Sacha Nacht to the author of "the best work on psychoanalytical technique and theory."</p>
<p>All previous students of the Psychoanalytic Institute of Paris as well as of every other psychoanalytic teaching institute, including foreign ones recognized by the International Psychoanalytical Association, will be eligible to compete.</p>
<p>Candidates must submit their unpublished papers before June 15 of the year in the course of which the prize will be awarded.  Contributions which do not win the prize remain at the disposal of the jury, which reserves the right of eventually publishing them under any form it finds suitable.  The jury is free to abstain from conferring the prize if none of the proposed papers meets the required qualities.  The competition will take place only if there are at least four candidates.</p>
<p>The best work will be designated by a jury composed of the functioning members of the Teaching Commission of the Psychoanalytic Institute of Paris.</p>
<h2 c="t">The Psychoanalytic Assistance Fund</h2>
<p>The Psychoanalytic Assistance Fund, Inc., thanks to contributions by members of the American, has been able to complete its organization and begin actual operations.  The Assistance Fund was created to coordinate the rendering of assistance to analysts and their families, both in this country and abroad, who fall into financial need, and to make contributions for these purposes tax-deductible.  Tax-exempt status will be applied for in the near future, and there is every reason to expect it will be granted.</p>
<pb><ftr><ftn type="PG" id="F001" label="1"><p>The papers in which the result of this work is presented were published in the <i>Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association:</i> "Dreams and Perception, " Vol. II, No. 3, pp. 389-445, 1954; "Dreams, Images and Perceptions, " Vol. IV, No. 1, pp. 5-48, 1956.</p>
</ftn></ftr><n nextpgnum="P0740" prefixused="">739</n></pb>
<p>To avoid duplication of effort the Assistance Fund is in the process of joining forces with the Ernest Jones Rehabilitation Fund, which has been raising moneys for needy analysts in Hungary and other European countries.  Dr. Rudolf Ekstein, heretofore the American Representative of the Jones Fund, has now become an officer of the Assistance Fund.  A letter will shortly go out to members of the American, and other individuals, appealing for a regular annual contribution to the Assistance Fund, so that there can be available at all times a financial reserve to be used when needed.</p>
<p>The officers of the Assistance Fund are:  President, Dr. Maxwell Gitelson; Vice-Presidents, Drs. Robert P. Knight, Emanuel Windholz and Rudolf Ekstein; Secretary-Treasurer, Dr. David Kairys.  The Board of Directors consists of Dr. Bertram D. Lewin, Dr. Gitelson and Dr. Kairys.  Communications should be addressed to the Secretary, at 55 East 86 Street, New York 28, N. Y.</p>
